An application for managing and reviewing media recomendations.

## Motivation

I like to get book, movie, and podcast recomendations from people I meet. I would like to keep track of those and create a queue of recommendations. It would be nice to keep notes and thought as well, so I can discuss with the source of the recommendations the topic.

This application isn't too serious, I am using it to practice TypeScript and Angular and deploying an app to Azure.
